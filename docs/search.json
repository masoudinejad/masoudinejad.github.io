    "text": "Greetings and thank you for visiting my personal webpage. I’m Mojtaba Masoudinejad (Farsi: مجتبی مسعودی نژاد), sometimes friends and colleagues call me Moji (😄 without an E). Originally hailing from the charming city of Dezfool/Dezful in southwest Iran, I’ve embarked on a journey that’s taken me all the way to Germany.\nSince the beginning of 2023 I have a role as a senior Machine Learning Engineer at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in Renningen, a part of the esteemed Robert Bosch GmbH. Before my tenure at Bosch, I dedicated two years as a PostDoc researcher in the DAES team at TU Dortmund University.\nIn July 2020, I successfully defended my PhD thesis, ending a long journey exploring the nuanced topic of “Modeling Energy Supply Unit of Ultra-low Power Devices with Indoor Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting”. This significant milestone was achieved under the collaborative guidance of Prof. Michael ten Hompel and Prof. Luca Benini, within the framework of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876, in collaboration with Fraunhofer IML in Dortmund, Germany. My academic journey commenced with an MSc in Automation and Robotics also from TU Dortmund University in 2011, following a BSc in Electrical Engineering with a major in Control and Systems Engineering from Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007."
